This is a very WIP implementation of [material-components-web](https://material.io/components?platform=web) for [go-app](https://go-app.dev).

So far, there are initial implementations of:

* Banner
* Button
* Card
* Drawer
* Floating Action Button (FAB)
* Icon button
* List
* Top App Bar

There's an `example` which demonstrates the components.

There are many features not implemented and inconsistencies in the component
interfaces, but adding any missing bits should be relatively straightforward.
